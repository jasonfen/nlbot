# First-time setup walkthrough

A 30-minute path from "I want one of these" to "it's running and I'm talking to it." Read [INTRO-FOR-HUMANS.md](INTRO-FOR-HUMANS.md) first if you haven't — it explains *why* this is a thing. This doc is the *how*.

*If a Claude Code instance is helping you with the install, it should read [setup-orchestrator.md](setup-orchestrator.md) first. That doc tells the assisting Claude how to walk through this one with you and track progress in `setup-state.md` so an interrupted setup can resume cleanly.*

## What you'll need before you start

- A Linux machine you can leave running (LXC container, spare laptop, small VPS — see [persistence-and-hardware.md](persistence-and-hardware.md) for the floor: 2 cores / 2 GB RAM / 8 GB disk).
- A Claude Code subscription (the CLI tool, not the API).
- A Telegram account with a phone (to talk to BotFather).
- About 30 minutes of focused time. You can stretch it over a weekend; nothing here is time-pressured.

## Step 1 — Install Claude Code + prereqs (5 min)

On the Linux box, follow the official install: <https://claude.com/download>. Then log in once interactively:

```bash
claude
```

Follow the prompts, accept the TOS. **Do this at a real terminal, not in a tmux session you'll later detach** — the TOS gate doesn't render well in a detached pane and the persistent setup we'll build relies on having that gate already cleared.

Verify the rest of the prereqs:

```bash
claude --version          # Claude Code installed
docker compose version    # Docker Engine + compose plugin (needed Step 5 — SilverBullet)
tmux -V                   # tmux installed
tailscale status          # Tailscale logged in (otherwise: sudo tailscale up)
node --version            # Node 20+ — only if doing the optional web shell (Step 7)
```

Anything that fails: install the missing piece before continuing. `docker compose version` is the trickiest — modern installs use the compose plugin (`docker compose`, two words), not the old standalone binary (`docker-compose`, hyphen).

## Step 2 — Drop in the vault (5 min)

Pick a directory name. The convention here is the bot's name + lowercase: `~/natebot`. From here on this doc uses `~/natebot/` as the vault root — substitute your own name throughout if you pick something else.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/natebot/journals ~/natebot/handoffs
cd ~/natebot

# If you ran bootstrap.md Step 9, you're already in the cloned repo:
KIT=$(pwd)
# Otherwise: KIT=/wherever/you/cloned/nlbot

cp $KIT/CLAUDE-nate.md       CLAUDE.md
cp -r $KIT/templates         templates
cp -r $KIT/dot-claude        .claude     # NOTE the rename: dot-claude → .claude

# Seed the bot's identity from the bundled templates
cp templates/identity.md     identity.md
cp templates/user-profile.md user-profile.md
cp templates/soul-loop.md    soul-loop.md

touch journals/journal.md inbox.md decisions.md
```

Now open `CLAUDE.md` in your editor and replace every `[Nate]` and `[Your Bot's Name]` placeholder with your actual name and the bot's name. Same with `identity.md` and `user-profile.md` — fill in the canary phrase, your role, what you want from this bot. There's no "right" answer; first-pass guesses are fine, you'll edit later.

**About the canary phrase:** in `identity.md`, you'll set a short string ("the lighthouse keeper waves at midnight" — anything memorable). The bot is supposed to remember it without re-reading the file. If at any point it can't recall the phrase, that's its signal it has lost context (post-restart, post-compaction) and needs to re-anchor by reading `identity.md` and `user-profile.md`. It's not a security secret; just an orientation anchor.

## Step 3 — Disable the keybindings that kill sessions (1 min)

Edit `~/.claude/keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "disabled": ["ctrl+x ctrl+e", "ctrl+x ctrl+k"]
}
```

Skip this and you'll discover why on day three. See [persistence-and-hardware.md](persistence-and-hardware.md) for the story.

> ### ⚠ Heads-up: two `.claude/` directories
>
> By this point in setup you have **two distinct `.claude/` directories** doing different things. People confuse them; this is the most common kit-bring-up footgun after the locale issue.
>
> | Path | Scope | What it holds |
> |---|---|---|
> | `~/.claude/` (your `$HOME`) | Global — applies to every Claude Code session you start as this unix user | `keybindings.json` (the file you just edited), `settings.json`, `mcp.json`, `projects/<encoded-cwd>/` (history), and any agents/commands/hooks you want available everywhere |
> | `~/<bot-name>/.claude/` (inside the vault, the renamed `dot-claude/` from Step 2) | Project — applies **only** when Claude Code is launched with the vault as its CWD | The kit's `agents/*.md` (soul-loop-runner, secretary, etc.) and `commands/*.md` (`/soul-loop`, `/secretary`, …) |
>
> Three specific things that bite:
>
> 1. **Forgetting the `dot-claude` → `.claude` rename in Step 2.** If you copied it as `dot-claude/` instead of `.claude/`, Claude Code won't find the project agents or slash commands and they'll silently do nothing — `/soul-loop` will just return "unknown command." Verify: `ls -d ~/<bot-name>/.claude` should show the directory.
>
> 2. **Editing the wrong `.claude/`.** Want a slash command everywhere? Edit `~/.claude/commands/`. Want one only in this vault? Edit `~/<bot-name>/.claude/commands/`. Both directories accept the same kinds of files; the difference is scope.
>
> 3. **Project config wins on merge.** If both directories contain `agents/secretary.md`, the vault's version overrides the global one when Claude Code is running with the vault as CWD. If you ever wonder "why isn't my edit taking effect," you might be editing the loser.
>
> Also worth knowing: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/` stores per-CWD session history. If you ever move the vault (`mv ~/oldname ~/newname`), the bot's "recent sessions" go orphaned and a fresh project entry is created under the new path. The journal and the bot itself are unaffected — only `claude --continue`'s memory of "what was I doing in that other directory" resets.

## Step 4 — Wire up persistence (10 min)

Copy the runtime scripts from this kit into the vault, then drop the systemd unit:

```bash
cp $KIT/runtime/start-claude.sh ~/natebot/start-claude.sh
chmod +x ~/natebot/start-claude.sh
# Edit the path inside if your vault isn't ~/natebot
```

Then drop the systemd unit at `/etc/systemd/system/claude-code.service` (template in [persistence-and-hardware.md](persistence-and-hardware.md) — change `User=` and the path).

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now claude-code.service
tmux ls                         # should show "claude" session
tmux attach -t claude           # see Claude Code running
# Check that the ❯ prompt renders correctly. If you see __ or ?? instead,
# the locale isn't set right in some shell context. See the "Glyph rendering"
# section in persistence-and-hardware.md — fix it before continuing.
# detach with ctrl+b then d (don't kill it)
```

**Reboot the box now and verify it comes back up.** This is non-negotiable — verify the persistence works before you start trusting it. After the reboot:

```bash
systemctl status claude-code.service     # active (running)
tmux attach -t claude                    # back in the session
```

## Step 5 — Set up SilverBullet (the vault editor) (5 min)

This is your daily interface to the bot's brain. Walked through fully in [silverbullet-setup.md](silverbullet-setup.md). The condensed version:

1. Generate two random secrets:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 24    # for SB_USER password
   openssl rand -base64 24    # for SB_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```
2. Drop a `docker-compose.yml` in `~/natebot/` with the silverbullet service block (template in [silverbullet-setup.md](silverbullet-setup.md)) — set `SB_USER=nate:<password>`, `SB_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>`, mount `~/natebot:/space`, bind `127.0.0.1:3001:3000`.
3. `docker compose up -d` and visit `http://localhost:3001`. Log in with the SB_USER credentials. You should see your vault.
4. Expose via Tailscale: `sudo tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:3001`. Now reachable from your phone at `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net`.
5. In SilverBullet's command palette, install the **TreeView** plug — it's essential for vault navigation.

You can now read `journals/journal.md` from your phone and leave handoff tasks (`- [ ] do X #handoff`) for the bot.

*Aware-of-but-recommended-against: [Portainer](portainer.md) is a popular browser Docker UI, but it doesn't play well with a Claude-managed bot — Claude edits `docker-compose.yml` directly via `docker compose up -d`, which causes Portainer's stack definition to drift from reality. If you want a UI for log tails specifically, [web-shell.md](web-shell.md) plus `docker compose logs -f` covers the same ground without the source-of-truth conflict. See [portainer.md](portainer.md) for the full reasoning.*

## Step 6 — Set up Telegram (10 min)

Walked through end-to-end in [telegram-integration.md](telegram-integration.md). The condensed version:

1. In Telegram, message `@BotFather`, send `/newbot`, follow prompts, save the token.
2. DM your new bot once. Then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` and find your `chat.id`.
3. Create `~/natebot/.telegram/config` with `BOT_TOKEN=`, `CHAT_ID=`, `BOT_USERNAME=`. `chmod 600` it.
4. Copy `tg-bot.py` and `tg-post.sh` from `runtime/` into `~/natebot/.telegram/`. Make them executable (`chmod +x`).
5. Drop `/etc/systemd/system/telegram-bot.service` (template in [telegram-integration.md](telegram-integration.md)). Enable and start.
6. DM your bot something — anything. `journalctl -u telegram-bot -f` should show the message arrive. The file `.telegram/new-messages.txt` should appear in your vault.

You won't see Claude reply yet — we haven't wired the heartbeat that nudges it.

## Step 7 — Optional: browser access (10 min)

Skip if you only need Telegram + SilverBullet. Add later if you find yourself wanting to *see* the live tmux session from your phone or another laptop. The web shell is a small Node.js server that attaches to your `claude` tmux session and renders it through xterm.js in the browser, login-protected and Tailscale-only.

Walked through end-to-end in [web-shell.md](web-shell.md). The condensed version:

1. Copy `web-terminal/` into `~/natebot/web-terminal/`.
2. `cd web-terminal && npm install`.
3. Create `.env` with `PORT=3000`, `SESSION_SECRET=<random>`, `UI_USERNAME=nate`, `UI_PASSWORD=<random>`.
4. Drop `/etc/systemd/system/<BOT_NAME>-web.service` (template in the doc). Enable and start.
5. `sudo tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
6. Visit `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net`, log in, watch Claude type.

On iOS, "Add to Home Screen" makes it behave like a native app (PWA manifest is included).

## Step 8 — Cron the heartbeat (5 min)

⚠ **Do this AFTER the verification reboot from Step 4 — not before.** If cron fires before the tmux session exists, `inject-prompt.sh` will silently noop and you'll think it's broken.

Copy the runtime cron files into the vault:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/natebot/cron-prompts
cp $KIT/runtime/inject-prompt.sh ~/natebot/cron-prompts/
cp $KIT/runtime/cron-prompts/*.md ~/natebot/cron-prompts/
chmod +x ~/natebot/cron-prompts/inject-prompt.sh
```

Then `crontab -e`:

```cron
# 10-min heartbeat during active hours
*/10 7-23 * * * <VAULT>/cron-prompts/inject-prompt.sh /soul-loop

# Morning wake-up (weekdays — adjust to your schedule)
30 7 * * 1-5 <VAULT>/cron-prompts/inject-prompt.sh /wake-up

# Midnight sync
5 0 * * * <VAULT>/cron-prompts/inject-prompt.sh /midnight-maintenance
```

Save. Within 10 minutes you should see soul-loop fires landing in `cron-prompts/job-log.md`. Now DM your bot — Claude should respond within a minute or two.

## Step 9 — Optional: vector memory (5 min)

You don't need this on day one. Add it in week 2–3 when grep starts feeling clunky. Setup is one command, walked through in [memory.md](memory.md). That doc also covers the secretary note-capture pattern (the cron-driven background note-taker) — useful once your conversations get long enough that you'd appreciate Claude writing the journal for you.

## What "done" looks like

- You DM the bot, it replies within a minute.
- `cron-prompts/job-log.md` shows clean heartbeat fires every 10 minutes.
- `journals/journal.md` has Claude's first morning entry.
- You reboot the box; everything comes back up in under 30 seconds.

If any of those fail, troubleshoot before adding more layers. A flaky persistent setup that you can't trust is worse than no setup at all.

## What to do in week one

- Talk to the bot conversationally on Telegram. Tell it about a project. See what it remembers.
- Ask it to journal something. Read what it wrote. Edit the journal directly if you want.
- Edit `user-profile.md` with what you've learned about how you want to work with it. The bot will read it on next wake-up.
- Don't add features yet. Watch what it does. The default decision menu is well-tuned; understand it before you change it.

## What to *not* do

- Don't run two bots from the same vault. They'll fight over the journal.
- Don't put secrets in the journal — it's plain Markdown, often committed to git.
- Don't run the bot on a laptop that sleeps. Soul-loop misses break the rhythm.
- Don't skip step 4's reboot test. You'll regret it.

## When you get stuck

- The persistent-Claude story across reboots is in [persistence-and-hardware.md](persistence-and-hardware.md). Most "it doesn't come back up" issues are answered there.
- Memory and note-capture questions: [memory.md](memory.md).
- Telegram weirdness: [telegram-integration.md](telegram-integration.md) has a troubleshooting section.
- Anything else: ask Claude. It has access to its own kit and can explain its own setup back to you.

That's it. ~30 minutes if everything goes smoothly, ~2 hours if it doesn't. Either way, by the end you have a thing that runs.
