# Re-sync kit-managed files into the working tree. Runs from the git
# post-merge hook so kit pulls propagate without manual reseeds.
#
# Three phases, with different ownership models:
#
#   1. <REPO_ROOT>/.claude/ — kit-owned, OVERWRITES on every run. Source
#      is <KIT>/dot-claude/, substituted for Phase-0 placeholders. Local
#      edits are blown away; fork the kit if you need to override.
#
#   2. <VAULT>/ vault-page seeds — user-owned, NO-CLOBBER. New files
#      from <KIT>/templates/vault-pages/ (CONFIG.md, _templates/handoff.md,
#      etc.) get seeded if absent; existing files are left alone so user
#      edits survive.
#
#   3. <VAULT>/_plug/ plug bundles — kit-managed but no-clobber per
#      bundle. Delegated to <KIT>/runtime/install-plugs.sh.
#
# Path triple:
#   REPO_ROOT = <repo_root>            — bot CWD, holds .claude/, cron-prompts/
#   KIT       = <repo_root>/kit/       — kit source
#   VAULT     = <repo_root>/vault/     — SilverBullet space
#
# Phase-0 values (BOT_NAME, USER_NAME, VAULT, OS_USER) come from
# <REPO_ROOT>/setup-state.md's Values block (setup-state.md lives at
# repo root, not in the vault).
