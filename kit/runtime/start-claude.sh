# Start Claude in a detached tmux session.
#
# Use --continue (auto-selects most recent session, no interactive picker)
# instead of --resume main (which can hit the Ink TUI picker if session list
# is ambiguous — the picker doesn't respond to tmux send-keys, blocking
# unattended startup). See decisions.md 2026-04-03 lockup.
#
# **Conditional --continue (F38, fenbot00 walk 2026-05-12):** on a *truly*
# fresh box (post-OAuth walk, zero prior conversation history), `claude
# --continue` exits rc=1 with "No conversation found to continue" instantly.
# The while-loop wrapper would then respawn into the same wall, so each
# claude-code.service restart crashloops indefinitely until a human types
# something into the pane to create a session. The fix is to check for
# session files inside $HOME/.claude/projects/ and only pass --continue
# when at least one exists. The check is inside the loop body so a
# brand-new box converges naturally: first iteration runs plain `claude`
# (creates a session as soon as a user prompts), subsequent iterations
# pick up --continue.
#
# Wrap the claude invocation in a while-loop with exponential backoff so
# the tmux session survives a clean exit of `claude` itself. The systemd
# unit's Restart=on-failure can't recover an exit-0 because exit-0 isn't
# a failure. Caught on nlbot0 walk (sidechat msg 2728, F21).
#
# Backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 80s → 160s → 300s (capped). Prevents a
# tight loop on persistent failure (bad OAuth state, missing binary mid-
# upgrade) while still recovering quickly from a one-shot exit.

# `set -m` enables job control inside the wrapper. Without it, a
# non-interactive `bash -c` invocation runs every child in the SAME
# process group as bash itself — so when claude runs as a child, bash
# stays the pgroup leader and `tmux pane_current_command` reports
# `bash`, not `claude`. inject-prompt.sh's pane selector filters for
# `pane_current_command == claude`, which then never matches and every
# cron fire defers indefinitely (F29 regression of F21, caught on
# nlbot0 sidechat msg 2759). With `set -m`, each command in the loop
# becomes its own pgroup leader → claude is the leader during its run
# → tmux reports `claude` → injector finds the pane.
