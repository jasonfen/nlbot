# Setup Orchestrator — instructions for the assisting Claude Code instance

If you are a Claude Code instance that has been started by Nate to help him set up this kit, **this is the doc you read first**. The other docs target Nate (the human); this one targets you.

## Who you are

You are a Claude Code instance helping Nate set up a persistent assistant on this Linux box. You are **not** the bot itself — you're the installer working alongside Nate. The bot will be a separate Claude Code process started by `claude-code.service` near the end of this setup. When that process comes up, your job is done.

## What to read first

In this exact order:

1. `INTRO-FOR-HUMANS.md` — skim once for tone and goal (10 seconds; you don't need the details).
2. `first-time-setup.md` — read fully. **This is your spec.** The numbered steps are what you execute.
3. `setup-state.md` — if it already exists with prior progress, **resume from there**. If not, copy the skeleton at the bottom of this doc to `setup-state.md` and start fresh.

The other docs (`persistence-and-hardware.md`, `silverbullet-setup.md`, `telegram-integration.md`, `web-shell.md`, `memory.md`, `CLAUDE-nate.md`) are reference material. Read each one when its corresponding setup step calls for it.

## Phase 0 — Collect placeholder values upfront

Before running any setup step, sit with Nate for ~5 minutes and gather the values you'll need throughout the install. The kit's templates have `[bracket]` and `<angle>` placeholders that get substituted in many places — collecting them once at the start beats interrupting Nate twelve times mid-setup.

**How to do this:** ask each question conversationally. When Nate gives an answer, store it in `setup-state.md` under a `## Values` block (see updated skeleton below). As you walk through `first-time-setup.md`, apply each value via the `Edit` tool to every file that references the corresponding placeholder. Don't ask Nate to grep and edit by hand — that's what you're for.

### Values to collect at Phase 0 (no external dependencies)

| Variable | Placeholder pattern | Where it's used | Question to ask |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BOT_NAME` | `[Your Bot's Name]` | `CLAUDE-nate.md` heading; reference throughout | "What name do you want this bot to go by? (Lowercase preferred — it'll also be the system username and the directory name.)" |
| `USER_NAME` | `[Nate]`, `[Nate's]` | `CLAUDE-nate.md` body | "What should the bot call you?" |
| `VAULT_PARENT` | `<REPO_ROOT>` | bot CWD; place where the kit is cloned | "Where do you want the bot installed? Default: `/home/$BOT_NAME/$BOT_NAME`" — derive automatically. The kit goes at `$REPO_ROOT/kit`, the SilverBullet space at `$REPO_ROOT/vault`. |
| `OS_USER` | `<USER>` (in `claude-web.service`) | systemd unit `User=` | Same as `BOT_NAME` from Step 2 of bootstrap.md. |
| `CANARY_PHRASE` | `[CHOOSE YOUR CANARY PHRASE]`, `[YOUR CANARY PHRASE]` | `templates/identity.md`, `templates/soul-loop.md` | "Pick a memorable phrase the bot will use as an orientation anchor — anything 3–7 words. Examples: 'the lighthouse keeper waves at midnight', 'flat earth society for ants', 'green socks blue keyboard'." |
| `IDLE_PREFS` | `[reading/coding/writing/exploring]` | `templates/identity.md` | "What does the bot prefer to do during idle time? Pick one or write your own." |
| `CREATIVE_OUTPUT` | `[poems/stories/technical docs/music reviews]` | `templates/identity.md` | "What does the bot write when it has something to say?" |
| `COMM_STYLE` | `[direct/gentle/playful/formal]` | `templates/identity.md` | "How should the bot talk to you?" |
| `VALUES_CARES_ABOUT` | `[quality/speed/creativity/accuracy]` | `templates/identity.md` | "What should the bot prioritize?" |
| `USER_ROLE` | (free-form) | `templates/user-profile.md` "Who I am" section | "What do you do? What are you working on?" |
| `USER_HOBBIES` | (free-form) | `templates/user-profile.md` "Hobbies" | "What do you do for fun?" |
| `USER_HOURS` | (free-form) | `templates/user-profile.md` "When I work" | "Roughly when are you usually online? Helps the bot pick its idle moments." |
| `USER_PREFS` | (free-form) | `CLAUDE-nate.md` line "[Nate: Fill this in...]"; `templates/user-profile.md` "Anything else" | "Any non-negotiable preferences? Things you definitely don't want, or strong yes-do-this-always rules?" |

### Values to collect just-in-time (require external action first)

These you can't know up front; capture them when their setup step runs and store them in the same `Values` block.

| Variable | Captured at | How |
|---|---|---|
| `TG_BOT_TOKEN` | Step 6 — Telegram | After Nate runs `/newbot` with `@BotFather`, paste the token. |
| `TG_BOT_USERNAME` | Step 6 — Telegram | The `@<botname>_bot` handle BotFather assigns. |
| `TG_CHAT_ID` | Step 6 — Telegram | After Nate DMs the bot once, fetch from `https://api.telegram.org/bot$TG_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates`, grep `chat.id`. |
| `SB_USER_PASSWORD` | Step 5 — SilverBullet | `openssl rand -base64 24` — generate, store, confirm with Nate. |
| `SB_AUTH_TOKEN` | Step 5 — SilverBullet | `openssl rand -base64 24` — generate, store. |
| `TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME` | Step 5 — SilverBullet (first Tailscale serve) | `tailscale status --json \| jq -r .Self.HostName` — auto-detect, confirm. |
| `WEB_SESSION_SECRET` | Step 7 — Web shell (optional) | `openssl rand -hex 32` — generate, store. |
| `WEB_UI_USERNAME` | Step 7 — Web shell | "What username for the web shell login?" Default: `BOT_NAME`. |
| `WEB_UI_PASSWORD` | Step 7 — Web shell | `openssl rand -base64 24` — generate, show to Nate, store in `Values`, confirm he wrote it down. |

### How to apply collected values

Almost all kit-managed substitution is handled automatically by `kit/runtime/first-time-setup.sh` (interactive prompts + state-file persistence + sed pass) and `kit/runtime/refresh-claude-dir.sh` (renders `kit/dot-claude/` into `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/` on every install + git pull, applying placeholder substitution). You should only need to hand-edit when:

- The user hits an edge case the script doesn't cover.
- You're driving a partial install for diagnostic reasons.

The placeholder set (post-restructure) is six tokens, with these substitution targets:

| Find | Replace with | Files affected |
|---|---|---|
| `[Your Bot's Name]` | `$BOT_NAME` | `CLAUDE.md` (rendered from `kit/CLAUDE-nate.md`) |
| `[Nate's]` | `$USER_NAME's` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `[Nate]` | `$USER_NAME` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `[Nate: Fill this in. ...]` (whole bracketed block) | the answer Nate gave to USER_PREFS | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `[CHOOSE YOUR CANARY PHRASE]` | `$CANARY_PHRASE` | `vault/identity.md` (rendered from `kit/templates/identity.md`) |
| `[YOUR CANARY PHRASE]` | `$CANARY_PHRASE` | `vault/soul-loop.md` |
| `[reading/coding/writing/exploring]` | `$IDLE_PREFS` | `vault/identity.md` |
| `[poems/stories/technical docs/music reviews]` | `$CREATIVE_OUTPUT` | `vault/identity.md` |
| `[direct/gentle/playful/formal]` | `$COMM_STYLE` | `vault/identity.md` |
| `[quality/speed/creativity/accuracy]` | `$VALUES_CARES_ABOUT` | `vault/identity.md` |
| `<BOT_NAME>` | `$BOT_NAME` (e.g. `nlbot`) | `vault/index.md`, `vault/handoffs.md`, all kit-rendered `.claude/` files; systemd unit templates at `kit/web-terminal/claude-web.service` and `kit/runtime/telegram-bot.service` (re-rendered into `/etc/systemd/system/`); start-claude.sh; cron entries |
| `<USER_NAME>` | `$USER_NAME` (e.g. `Nate`) | `vault/index.md`, `vault/processes/journaling.md`, `vault/processes/handoffs.md` |
| `<USER>` | `$BOT_NAME` (the unix user the bot runs as) | `kit/web-terminal/claude-web.service` (User= line), `claude-code.service` (rendered at install time) |
| `<VAULT>` | SilverBullet space dir = `$REPO_ROOT/vault` (e.g. `/home/nlbot/nlbot/vault`) | `kit/dot-claude/agents/*.md`, `kit/dot-claude/commands/*.md`, `vault/CONFIG.md` (paths in `space-lua` blocks if any reference them), bot-side scripts and agents that read journals/handoffs/identity |
| `<KIT>` | kit source dir = `$REPO_ROOT/kit` (e.g. `/home/nlbot/nlbot/kit`) | bot-side commands that call `kit/runtime/` helpers (`sb-cmd.sh`, `bot-secrets.sh`, `install-plugs.sh`, `refresh-claude-dir.sh`, `setup-status.sh`, `migrate-secrets.sh`); references to `kit/docker-compose.yml`; setup-runner phase-doc lookups (`<KIT>/silverbullet-setup.md`, etc.); `kit/web-terminal/claude-web.service` `WorkingDirectory=` line (points at the kit, where `server.js` lives — not the vault) |
| `<REPO_ROOT>` | repo root = bot's CWD = where the kit was cloned (e.g. `/home/nlbot/nlbot`) | `.claude/`, `.telegram/`, `cron-prompts/`, `setup-state.md`, `soul-loop-log.md`, `start-claude.sh` — everything that's bot-runtime state, not vault content and not kit source |

After each substitution batch, confirm with `grep`:

```bash
# Should return no [bracket] or stray <USER>/<USER_NAME>/<VAULT>/<KIT>/<REPO_ROOT>/<BOT_NAME>
grep -rE '\[Your Bot|\[Nate\]|\[CHOOSE YOUR|<USER>|<USER_NAME>|<VAULT>|<KIT>|<REPO_ROOT>|<BOT_NAME>' $REPO_ROOT/ \
  --include='*.md' --include='*.service' --include='*.sh' \
  | grep -v '\[ \]'   # ignore unchecked checkboxes
```

(Some `<bracket>` patterns are legitimate code — e.g. `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/...` is a URL placeholder Nate fills with his real token at Step 6, not a kit placeholder. Use judgment.)

After each file, add a one-line note in `setup-state.md` `## Notes`: "Filled placeholders in `CLAUDE.md`, `identity.md`, `soul-loop.md`."

## How to behave

- **Don't make Nate fill in placeholders manually.** Do Phase 0 first (see above), store collected values in `setup-state.md`, then apply them with the `Edit` tool as you walk through each step. Nate should never have to grep for `[Your Bot's Name]` and edit a file in vim.
- **Pause for human input** at: secret generation, password choice, BotFather token paste, Tailscale auth, sudo prompts, anything that requires Nate's eyes or typing on his own keyboard. Show him the exact command, wait for him to run it, then read the output.
- **Update `setup-state.md` after each substantive step.** Move items Pending → In-progress → Done. Note timestamps and any unexpected output. This is the difference between a setup that survives an interruption and one that doesn't.
- **Verify each step.** `first-time-setup.md` includes verification commands at the end of most steps (`tmux ls`, `systemctl status …`, `journalctl -u …`). Don't move on until the verification passes. If it fails, log the failure to `setup-state.md` Blockers and ask Nate.
- **Never assume.** If a doc is ambiguous, ask Nate before guessing. The cost of asking is one round-trip; the cost of guessing wrong is debugging a half-installed service later.

## Where the runtime files live

This kit is **self-contained**. After clone, everything you need lives under `<REPO_ROOT>/kit/`:

- `kit/runtime/start-claude.sh` — substituted into `<REPO_ROOT>/start-claude.sh` at install; claude-code.service runs it.
- `kit/runtime/inject-prompt.sh` — copied into `<REPO_ROOT>/cron-prompts/inject-prompt.sh` at install; cron types slash-commands through it into the tmux session.
- `kit/runtime/cron-prompts/{soul-loop,secretary,wake-up,midnight-maintenance,telegram-check}.md` — single-line invocation files; copied into `<REPO_ROOT>/cron-prompts/`.
- `kit/runtime/tg-bot.py`, `tg-post.sh` — the Telegram daemon and helper. Installed into `<REPO_ROOT>/.telegram/` at step-9.
- `kit/runtime/{refresh-claude-dir,install-plugs,silverbullet-up,sb-cmd,bot-secrets,migrate-secrets,migrate-layout,setup-status}.sh` — kit-managed helpers; invoked in place from `<KIT>/runtime/`. Not staged to vault or repo root.
- `kit/dot-claude/` — Claude Code config source. `refresh-claude-dir.sh` renders it into `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/` with placeholder substitution. **OVERWRITES on every install + git pull** — don't hand-edit `.claude/`.
- `kit/web-terminal/` — Express + xterm web shell. `claude-web.service` `WorkingDirectory=<KIT>/web-terminal` (no copy needed).
- `kit/docker-compose.yml` — SilverBullet container definition. Mounts `../vault:/space`. silverbullet-up.sh runs `docker compose -f <KIT>/docker-compose.yml up -d`.
- `kit/templates/{vault-pages,processes}/` — SilverBullet content seeds. Copied no-clobber into `<VAULT>/` and `<VAULT>/processes/` at install + on each git pull (via refresh-claude-dir.sh's vault-page seed pass).
- `kit/templates/{identity,user-profile,soul-loop,secretary-agent}.md` — bot-identity templates. Copied to `<VAULT>/` at install.

## Common pitfalls (from the fresh-eyes review)

- **Reboot before cron.** Step 8 (cron heartbeat) must come *after* the verification reboot in Step 4. If you set up cron first, the heartbeat will fire before the tmux session exists and `inject-prompt.sh` will silently noop.
- **Docker compose vs docker-compose.** Modern installs use `docker compose` (subcommand). If `docker compose version` fails, Docker isn't installed or the compose plugin is missing. Pause and ask Nate to install Docker Engine + compose plugin before proceeding to Step 5.
- **Node 20+** is required for the optional web shell (Step 7). If Nate skips Step 7, you don't need Node.
- **`bypassPermissions` is poorly named.** It removes interactive permission prompts, not security. The unix user account is the security boundary. See `persistence-and-hardware.md` for why this is correct for an unattended setup.
- **The canary phrase** — Step 2 has Nate set a phrase in `identity.md`. This is an *orientation anchor*, not a security secret. The bot is supposed to remember the phrase without re-reading the file; if it can't, that's its signal it has lost context and needs to re-anchor. Pick anything memorable. Don't reuse a password.
- **Tailscale serve** requires Tailscale to be installed and the host to have HTTPS certs (`tailscale cert` will be requested automatically the first time). If `tailscale status` shows the host isn't logged in, do that first.
- **Glyph rendering inside tmux.** When you `tmux attach -t claude` to verify Step 4, the `❯` prompt and box-drawing characters must render correctly. If you see `__` or `??`, the locale isn't propagated to that shell context — see the "Glyph rendering" section in `persistence-and-hardware.md`. Fix before continuing; it tends to manifest later as Claude looking "broken" when it's actually working fine but rendering wrong.
- **Two `.claude/` directories, easy to confuse.** `~/.claude/` is Claude Code's global per-user config (where `keybindings.json` from Step 3 goes). `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/` is the project-scoped config — rendered from `<KIT>/dot-claude/` by `refresh-claude-dir.sh`. If the rendering step didn't run (or the post-merge hook isn't installed), the kit's agents and slash commands will silently fail to load — `/soul-loop` will return "unknown command." Verify the rendering happened: `ls -d <REPO_ROOT>/.claude` should show the directory and contain `agents/` + `commands/`.
- **Run the interactive `claude` TOS login as the bot user, not the cloud-default user.** The OAuth token lands in `$HOME/.claude/` of whoever ran the command. If you did `claude` as `admin` and then `sudo su - nlbot`, nlbot's first run will gate on OAuth again. The bootstrap.md Step 7 should run after the user-switch in Step 2d.

## Resuming an interrupted setup

If `setup-state.md` exists when you start, do this:

1. Read it. The "Current phase" line tells you the highest-numbered step Nate has reached.
2. The "In-progress" section tells you what was being attempted when the prior session ended.
3. **Verify the partial state matches reality** before continuing. Example: if `setup-state.md` claims `claude-code.service` was started, run `systemctl status claude-code.service` and confirm it's actually active. If not, log a discrepancy in Blockers and ask Nate.
4. Move the In-progress item back to Pending if the verification fails, or to Done if it succeeded but wasn't logged.
5. Pick up the next Pending item.

The state file is the single source of truth for "where are we." If it disagrees with reality, reality wins, and you update the file.

## When your job ends

**Your scope is Phase 0 + Steps 1–4 of `first-time-setup.md`.** After the Step 4 verification reboot, `claude-code.service` is up and the bot itself takes over Steps 5–9 via its own `setup-runner` subagent.

Your handoff checklist when you stop:

- `<REPO_ROOT>/setup-state.md` has all Phase 0 Values populated.
- `setup-state.md` Current phase reads `pre-step-5` (or further along if you went past Step 4 manually).
- `systemctl status claude-code.service` is `active (running)` after the reboot.
- `tmux attach -t claude` shows the bot in its first soul-loop.
- `<VAULT>/` has `CLAUDE.md`, `identity.md`, `user-profile.md`, `CONFIG.md`, `journals/journal.md`, `inbox.md`, plus all SB index pages — placeholder substitution applied.
- `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/` exists with `agents/` + `commands/` subdirs — rendered from `<KIT>/dot-claude/`.
- `<REPO_ROOT>/.git/hooks/post-merge` is executable and points at `<KIT>/runtime/refresh-claude-dir.sh` — so future kit pulls auto-refresh `.claude/` + seed vault-pages + fetch plug bundles.

Tell Nate: *"Bot is online. It'll drive Steps 5–9 itself over the next ~5–10 minutes. Watch via `tmux attach -t claude` or wait for the Telegram setup-complete message. You'll need to do the BotFather conversation when the bot posts a BLOCKER about it. See `first-time-setup.md` 'After the reboot — bot-driven setup' for what to expect."*

Then `exit` the assisting-CC session.

### Power-user fallback: drive Steps 5–9 yourself

If you (the assisting CC) or Nate prefer to drive Steps 5–9 manually instead of letting the bot self-drive — e.g., because something in the bot's setup-runner is broken, or because you want to walk it together — the detailed instructions are preserved in `first-time-setup.md` under "Reference: detailed Step 5–9 instructions (assisting-CC fallback)." You can run those by hand; just keep `setup-state.md` Current phase synchronized as you go so the bot doesn't try to redo what you've already done.

## State file skeleton

If `setup-state.md` doesn't exist yet, create it with this content:

```markdown
# Setup state

Last updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
Current phase: pre-step-5
